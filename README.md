# CoastalCave
Fallout 4 Settlement Mod

This is a zip of the plugin and scripts for my Fallout 4 settlement mod. The mod is also available on Nexus Mods and Bethesda.net for PC.

Description
-----------------------
For those that believe there are not enough underground locations in the game or are looking for a player home in a dark, 
murky cave then this is the mod for you!  This new location features unique weapons and enemy NPCs and includes most of 
the crafting workbenches in the game (power armor, chemistry, armor, weapons, food).  


Location
-----------------------
The cave is accessed by a drainage pipe located East of Coastal Cottage and North of the Museum of Witchcraft.


Unique Weapons
-----------------------
 - Railroader's Delight:  A railway gun with greatly increased fire rate but reduced damage.
 - Bucking Bronco:  A .44 magnum revolver with increased damage but greatly increased recoil.
 - Franz's Dinner Knife:  A combat knife with slightly increased damage.


Item Ids
-----------------------
(In the case that you can't locate an item, you can add them to you inventory via the console commands below.)
 - Coastal Cave Key:  player.additem 07004FD3 
 - Railroader's Delight:  player.additem 07008E95 
 - Bucking Bronco:  player.additem 07006F29
 - Franz's Dinner Knife:  player.additem 07006F24


Notes
-----------------------
 - Recommended level on Normal difficulty: 15 - 20
 - You must defeat the raider leader - Hector - before the settlement workbench will unlock.
 - If the settlement doesn't unlock when Hector is defeated, try opening your console in front of the workbench, 
   click it with your mouse to select it, and enter the command "SetPapyrusVar OwnedByPlayer 1" without the quotations.
 - (Minor Spoiler) If you can't locate Hector, there is an underwater tunnel that bypasses the locked doors and leads 
   to his room.


Manual Installation
-----------------------
Download the .zip file and extract the contents into the Data folder typically located at: 
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Fallout 4\Data


Known Bugs
-----------------------
 - Followers will not travel to Coastal Cave when they are dismissed.
 - The fast travel location in the cave is not changed by placing a Fast Travel Target (welcome mat) with the workshop.
